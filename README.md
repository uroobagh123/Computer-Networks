# Computer Networks

This repository contains my **lab tasks**, **configurations**, **network simulations**, and **project** from the Computer Networks course, implemented and tested using **Cisco Packet Tracer** and **Wireshark**.

## üìÇ Contents

- **Introduction to Cisco Packet Tracer** ‚Äî Overview of the tool, creating devices, adding modules, and making connections.
- **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** ‚Äî Configuring DHCP servers and clients to dynamically assign IP addresses and network parameters.
- **Domain Name System (DNS)** ‚Äî Setting up and testing DNS client queries, understanding recursive and iterative resolution.
- **Static & Dynamic Routing** ‚Äî Configuring and verifying:
  - **Static Routing**
  - **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**
  - **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**
  - **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**
- **Route Redistribution** ‚Äî Implementing route redistribution between OSPF, EIGRP, and RIP.
- **HTTP Protocol Analysis (Wireshark)** ‚Äî Capturing and analyzing HTTP GET/response interactions, message formats, large file transfers, embedded objects, and authentication.
- **Network Troubleshooting** ‚Äî Verification and debugging of routing protocols and connectivity issues.

## üí° Topics Covered

- Cisco Packet Tracer fundamentals
- Creating and connecting network devices
- DHCP server and client configuration
- DNS resolution process
- Static vs. dynamic routing
- OSPF, EIGRP, and RIP configurations
- Route redistribution between protocols
- HTTP protocol inspection using Wireshark
- Network verification and troubleshooting

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Open and Run the Labs

### Cisco Packet Tracer Labs:
1. Open **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
2. Load the `.pkt` file from the relevant folder.
3. Follow the lab instructions to run and test the configurations.

### Wireshark Labs:
1. Install **Wireshark**.
2. Open the `.pcap` capture files provided in the labs.
3. Use the filter bar to analyze the required protocol traffic.

## üìå Notes

- Cisco Packet Tracer version **8.x or above** is recommended for compatibility.
- Wireshark labs require basic knowledge of packet capture and filtering.
- Lab exercises are based on course modules and textbook references.
